Collision-free Linkages
=======================

This section provides an overview on the collision-free linkage optimization problem.

Combinatorial Optimization
--------------------------

One of the approaches implements the algorithm developed by :footcite:t:`Li2020`.
A special thanks goes to the authors Zijia Li from KLMM, Chinese Academy of Sciences,
China and Georg Nawratil from the Institute of Discrete Mathematics and Geometry,
TU Wien, Austria, who kindly helped us to implement the algorithm.
