Dynamics Simulations - Exudyn Integration
=========================================

.. include:: ../refs-weblinks.rst

The package provides an interface to the `Exudyn`_
flexible multibody dynamics simulation library by :footcite:t:`Gerstmayr2023`,
developed at the Department of Mechatronics, University of Innsbruck, Austria.

**Exudyn** is lightweight, written in C++, and provides a Python interface
for easy usage and integration. The library supports large deformations
and handles can handle contact and friction problems.
It offers a variety of joints and forces for comprehensive simulation
capabilities. Its flexibility makes it suitable for a broad spectrum
of dynamic simulations.
